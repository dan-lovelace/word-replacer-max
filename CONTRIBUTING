# Contributing

This project is not currently accepting external contributions.

## Why?

This repository contains only a subset of source code extracted from a larger
monorepo. It's not designed to be maintained as a standalone project, and
contributions here wouldn't integrate back into the main codebase. We appreciate
your interest in the project.

## Questions?

For questions about the project itself, feel free to open an issue. While we
won't accept pull requests, we're happy to discuss the project's direction or
clarify implementation details.

## Future Changes

This policy may change in the future. Watch the repository if you'd like to be
notified of any updates to our contribution guidelines.
